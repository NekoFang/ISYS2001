Me: how would i go about repeating the original 5 day forecast code so that i can search multiple locations without having to refresh the code

GPT: To **allow multiple 5-day weather searches** without restarting or re-running your code, you should wrap your logic in a **loop** that keeps prompting the user until they choose to exit.

Since you're required to use **`pyinputplus`** for your menu system, we‚Äôll use `pyinputplus.inputMenu()` to give the user a nice, repeatable interface.

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Plan:

1. Import `pyinputplus` as `pyip`
2. Create a menu loop that asks:

   * "Do you want to check another location?"
3. Wrap the weather display in that loop
4. Exit gracefully if the user selects ‚ÄúExit‚Äù

### üì¶ Required Package

```bash
pip install pyinputplus
```

### ‚úÖ Updated Code with Loop and Menu

```python
import requests
import pyinputplus as pyip

def get_weather_data(location):
    """
    Fetches weather data from wttr.in for the given location.
    """
    url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"[Error] Could not fetch weather data: {e}")
        return None

def display_weather(location):
    """
    Displays current weather and a 5-day forecast for the location.
    """
    data = get_weather_data(location)
    if not data:
        return

    current = data['current_condition'][0]
    print(f"\nWeather for {location.title()}")
    print("-" * 30)
    print(f"Current Temp: {current['temp_C']}¬∞C")
    print(f"Condition: {current['weatherDesc'][0]['value']}\n")

    days = data['weather'][:5]  # Limit to 5 days
    for day in days:
        date = day['date']
        maxtemp = day['maxtempC']
        mintemp = day['mintempC']
        rain_chance = day['hourly'][4]['chanceofrain']
        print(f"Date: {date}")
        print(f"High: {maxtemp}¬∞C, Low: {mintemp}¬∞C, Rain: {rain_chance}%\n")

def main():
    """
    Main loop that keeps asking for locations until user exits.
    """
    print("üå§Ô∏è Welcome to Weather Advisor!")
    
    while True:
        location = input("\nEnter a location to view the weather: ")
        display_weather(location)

        repeat = pyip.inputMenu(["Yes", "No"], prompt="Would you like to check another location?\n", numbered=True)
        if repeat == "No":
            print("Thank you for using Weather Advisor! Stay safe! ‚òî")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### üîÅ Why This Works

* **Looping with `while True`** lets users check as many locations as they want.
* **`pyinputplus.inputMenu()`** gives a clear and validated Yes/No choice, avoiding input errors.
* If the user says ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, the loop breaks and the app exits gracefully.

Would you like to expand this menu further next (e.g., choose between current weather, forecast, or rain chance)?
