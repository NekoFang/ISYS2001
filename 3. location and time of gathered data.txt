Me: I would like you to edit this code so i can see the time the data was gathered, as well as the location data so that users are certain when and where the data is coming from

Absolutely ‚Äî let‚Äôs update your `display_weather()` function to show both:

1. ‚úÖ The **time the weather data was observed** (converted to local system time)
2. ‚úÖ The **resolved location information** from the wttr.in API response

---

### üîÅ Key Additions:

* `observation_time` (UTC) ‚Üí converted to **local time** using built-in `datetime` only (no `pytz`)
* `nearest_area[0]` contains location info like area name, region, and country

---

### ‚úÖ Updated Code with Time and Location Details

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs New:

* Shows:
  `Weather for: Perth, Western Australia, Australia`
  `Data last updated at: 01:03 PM (AWST)`

* This provides users with **confidence** in both:

  * **Where** the data applies
  * **When** the data was captured (in local time)

---

Let me know if you'd like to add **forecast time intervals**, or even a timestamp showing **when the user queried** the data for full traceability.
