# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
The only AI tool I used was GPTo4-mini as it is better at coding and logic compared to GPT4o. I chose not to explore other AI tools because im familiar with GPT and i find using completely new software for assignments scary in a way, however i understand that this is probably a internal bias of mine and there are most likely many other better AI tools that are better at coding than GPT.

## Prompting Techniques
There were a couple of things that i decided to do in regards to prompting that i found really useful. Overall my prompting was mostly focused on an iterative process. I decided to segment the work either before the "working" prompt or i would do it within the "working" prompt, and example of this would be "I need to write a weather app, the current focus is graphic visualisations" and then id describe what i want in depth in order for there to be little misunderstanding in what i wanted for the outcome. Another thing i tried to keep in mind was making sure GPT explained the reasoning a process between every decision so that i can get a clearer view on if/where it went wrong and how i can.

## What Worked Well?
I think i prompted GPT well enough that it was able to understand my thoughts and direction, and with the direction i gave it made it alot easier to spot errors and either manually fix or ask gpt to adjust the code. I had kept the assessment checklist and outline in mind so that fulfilling those requirements were always put first. I believe the process i took of making modules of each particular function testing them and then integrating them had made it easier for me to find errors or places to improve.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Because im not too confident in my coding ability i lowered the scope to fulfill the assessment requirements, If i wanted to take this to the next level i would've integrated historical data gathering, a settings menu where you can edit number of days you want to view, or change the graphing parameters. To do this i would definitely have to source my data through a different website. I would also explore the natural language interfacing with alot more depth e.g. use it to set variables, have a broader spectrum of compatible commands. I think there are many ways in which i could improve/expand the scope of the application, however i feel satisfied with the work i have submitted.

## Final Thoughts
I think the final product is satisfactory to the assessment and satisfactory in my own mind. I really enjoyed this assessment and feel well acomplished with the work i did.
