# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
I used GPT, it helped significantly by telling me where im at fault and giving me ideas when i need.

## Prompting Techniques
I usually went through an iterative strategy so that i can analyse if theres any issues with code before i integrate it into the final work

## What Worked Well?
Im unsure however im proud of my work, i think its effective

## What Would You Do Differently?
Id probably add more features maybe a historical weather search.

## Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed this
